# STEDI-Human-Balance-Analytics

The STEDI team has developed an innovative Step Trainer device that helps users practice balance exercises. The device collects data via integrated sensors and interacts with a mobile app that utilizes the phone's accelerometer. This data is used to train machine learning algorithms to accurately detect steps in real-time.

STEDI has gained a significant number of early adopters who are excited about using this technology. A subset of these users has agreed to share their data for research purposes, allowing STEDI to build a robust dataset while maintaining user privacy. Only the data from these consenting customers is included in the machine learning training dataset.
