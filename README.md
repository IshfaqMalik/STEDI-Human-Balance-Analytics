# STEDI-Human-Balance-Analytics

The STEDI team has developed an innovative Step Trainer device that helps users practice balance exercises. The device collects data via integrated sensors and interacts with a mobile app that utilizes the phone's accelerometer. This data is used to train machine learning algorithms to accurately detect steps in real-time.

STEDI has gained a significant number of early adopters who are excited about using this technology. A subset of these users has agreed to share their data for research purposes, allowing STEDI to build a robust dataset while maintaining user privacy. Only the data from these consenting customers is included in the machine learning training dataset.
#Project Description
This project involves curating and processing the data generated by the STEDI Step Trainer and its companion mobile app to create a lakehouse solution. This solution provides a centralized repository of well-structured data for data scientists to train machine learning models.

The lakehouse is built using AWS Glue, AWS S3, Python, and Spark, and is designed to handle semi-structured sensor data. The project involves setting up storage zones (landing, trusted, and curated), performing data transformations, and organizing datasets to be queried efficiently.

# Project Datasets
The project utilizes three primary datasets:

Customer Records: Collected from the STEDI website and fulfillment system.
Step Trainer Records: Sensor data capturing object motion distance.
Accelerometer Records: Mobile app data capturing motion in X, Y, and Z directions.

# Implementation
Landing Zone
Raw data for customers, accelerometers, and step trainers is stored in the landing zone on AWS S3. AWS Glue Data Catalog tables are created for these datasets to enable querying via AWS Athena.

Customer Landing Table: Contains raw customer data.

Accelerometer Landing Table: Contains raw accelerometer data from the mobile app.
Step Trainer Landing Table: Contains raw Step Trainer sensor data.

# Trusted Zone
In the trusted zone, AWS Glue jobs are used to transform and sanitize the raw data from the landing zone. These transformations filter data to include only records relevant to the research needs.

Customer Data Transformation:

Script: customer_landing_to_trusted.py

Filters customer records to include only those who have consented to share their data for research.

Accelerometer Data Transformation:

Script: 'accelerometer_landing_to_trusted_zone.py'

Filters accelerometer readings for customers who consented to share their data, based on a join with the customer_trusted table.

Step Trainer Data Transformation:


Script: trainer_landing_to_trusted.py

Filters Step Trainer records for customers who have accelerometer data and have consented to data sharing, using a join with the customer_curated table.
The resulting trusted tables contain sanitized datasets for use in further analysis.
